This is my implementation of the popular 2048 game using JavaScript, with a special emphasis on utilizing the DOM for game interactions and rendering.

The game mechanics are entirely powered by JavaScript, and the DOM manipulation is crucial for updating the game board and handling user interactions.
Feel free to explore the code and play the game!
